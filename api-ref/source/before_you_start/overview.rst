Welcome to Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM provides identity authentication, permissions management, and access control. With IAM, you can create and manage users and grant them permissions to allow or deny their access to cloud resources.

You can use IAM through the console or application programming interfaces (APIs). This document describes how to use APIs to perform operations on IAM, such as creating users and user groups and obtaining tokens.
