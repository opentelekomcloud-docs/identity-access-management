What Is My Credential?
======================

The **My Credential** page centrally displays users' security credentials and enables users to manage their credentials. When users access the public cloud
system (Open Telekom Cloud) or perform service interconnection in the public cloud system, they must use their own security credentials. On the **My
Credential** page, users can view the project ID and domain name, change the verified mobile number and email address, change the password, and manage access
keys (AK/SK).
