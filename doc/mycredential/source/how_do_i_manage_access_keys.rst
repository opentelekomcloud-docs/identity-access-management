How Do I Manage Access Keys?
============================

The access key ID (AK) and secret access key (SK) are a pair of access keys used together to authenticate users who make API requests. The AK/AS pair provides
similar functions as the password. When users make API requests to manage cloud resources (for example, creating a VPC), the AK and SK are required to sign the
requests. This mechanism ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the requests as well as the correctness of the identities of both parties. Access keys can
be generated and managed on the **My Credential** page.

Procedure

         .. note::  

            Each user can create a maximum of two access keys, which are valid permanently. To ensure account security, change access keys periodically and keep them
            safe.

      b. Enter **Login Password** and **Verification Code**.

      c. Click **OK** to generate and download the access key.

   -  Delete an access key.

      a. Click **Delete**.

      b. Enter **Login Password** and **Verification Code**.

      c. Click **OK**.

         .. note::  

            -  If an access key is used improperly (for example, an access key is missing or is leaked), you must delete it immediately or contact the administrator to
               reset it.

            -  Deleted access keys cannot be restored.
