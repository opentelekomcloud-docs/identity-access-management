Modifying User Permissions
==========================

You can modify user permissions using either of the following methods:

-  Change the user groups to which a user belongs on the **Modify User** page. Choose this method if you want to modify the permissions of a single user. For details, see :ref:`Viewing and Modifying User Information <en-us_topic_0046661675>`.
-  Modify the permissions of a user group or change the users included in the user group. Choose this method if you want to modify the permissions of multiple users. For details, see :ref:`Viewing and Modifying User Group Information <en-us_topic_0085605493>`.
