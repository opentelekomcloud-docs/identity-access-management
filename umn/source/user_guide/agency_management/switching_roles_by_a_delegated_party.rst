Switching Roles (by a Delegated Party)
======================================

When an account establishes a trust relationship between itself and your account, you become a delegated party. You and all the users you have authorized can switch to the delegating account and manage resources under the account based on assigned permissions.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A trust relationship has been established between another account and your account.
-  You have obtained the name of the delegating account and the agency name.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the system as the user created in :ref:`3 <iam_01_0063__li695863494610>` of :ref:`Assigning Permissions to a User (by a Delegated Party) <iam_01_0063>`.

   .. note::

      The user created in :ref:`3 <iam_01_0063__li695863494610>` of :ref:`Assigning Permissions to a User (by a Delegated Party) <iam_01_0063>` can switch roles to manage resources for the delegating party.

#. Point to the domain name in the upper right corner of the page and choose **Switch Role**.
#. On the **Switch Role** page, enter the domain name of the delegating party.

   .. note::

      If an agency other than the agencies created by the delegating party is displayed, it indicates that you do not have access permissions. Select the correct agency in the **Agency Name** drop-down list.

#. Click **OK** to switch to the delegating account.
