Delegating Resource Access to Another Account
=============================================

Agency is a trust relationship between a delegating account and a delegated account. By creating an agency, you can grant permissions to another account or cloud service for resource management.

This section uses account A and account B as an example to describe how to delegate an account to manage resources under another account.

#. Account A creates an agency to delegate resource access to account B.
