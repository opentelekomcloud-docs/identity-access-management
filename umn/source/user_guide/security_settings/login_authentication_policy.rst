Login Authentication Policy
===========================

The **Login Authentication Policy** tab of the :ref:`Security Settings <iam_07_0001__en-us_topic_0179264308_en-us_topic_0179263545_section113256158575>` page provides the :ref:`Session Timeout <iam_01_0704__en-us_topic_0177717040_en-us_topic_0176803438_section10968105732412>`, :ref:`Account Lockout <iam_01_0704__en-us_topic_0177717040_en-us_topic_0176803438_section13189358>`, :ref:`Recent Login Information <iam_01_0704__en-us_topic_0177717040_en-us_topic_0176803438_section446533912253>`, :ref:`Recent Login Information <iam_01_0704__en-us_topic_0177717040_en-us_topic_0176803438_section446533912253>`, and :ref:`Custom Information <iam_01_0704__en-us_topic_0177717040_en-us_topic_0176803438_section733474592515>` settings. These settings take effect for both your account and the IAM users created using the account.

Only the :ref:`administrator <iam_01_0023__section1475194083513>` can configure the login authentication policy, and IAM users can only view the configurations. If an IAM user needs to modify the configurations, the user can request the administrator to perform the modification or grant the required permissions.

Account Disabling
-----------------

Set a validity period to disable IAM users if they have not accessed the cloud platform using the console or APIs within a certain period.

If you enable this option, the setting will take effect only for IAM users created using your account. If an IAM user is disabled, the user can request the administrator to enable their account again.
