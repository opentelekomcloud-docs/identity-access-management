Basic Information
=================

As an account administrator, both you and your IAM users can manage basic information on this page.

.. note::

   -  A mobile number or an email address can be bound only to one account or IAM user.
   -  Only one mobile number, email address, and virtual MFA device can be bound to an account or IAM user.

Changing the Login Password, Mobile Number, Virtual MFA Device, or Email Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The methods for changing the login password, mobile number, virtual MFA device, and email address are similar. To change the login password, do as follows:

#. Go to the :ref:`Security Settings <iam_07_0001__en-us_topic_0179264308_en-us_topic_0179263545_section113256158575>` page.
#. Click the **Basic Information** tab, and click **Change** in the **Login Password** row.
#. (Optional) Select email address or mobile number verification, and enter the verification code.

   .. note::

      If no email address or mobile number is bound, no verification is required.

#. Enter the old password and new password, and enter the new password again.

   .. note::

      -  The password cannot be the username or the username spelled backwards. For example, if the username is **A12345**, the password cannot be **A12345**, **a12345**, **54321A**, or **54321a**.
      -  To prevent password cracking, the administrator can configure the password policy to define password requirements, such as minimum password length. For details, see :ref:`Password Policy <iam_01_0607>`.

#. Click **OK**.
