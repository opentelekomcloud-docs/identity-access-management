Basic Information
=================

As an account administrator, both you and your IAM users can manage basic information on this page.

.. note::

   -  A mobile number or an email address can be bound only to one account or IAM user.
   -  Only one mobile number, email address, and virtual MFA can be bound to an account or IAM user.

Changing the Login Password, Mobile Number, Virtual MFA Device, or Email Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The methods for changing the login password, mobile number, virtual MFA device, and email address are similar. To change the login password, do as follows:

#. Go to the :ref:`Security Settings <iam_07_0001__en-us_topic_0179264308_en-us_topic_0179263545_section113256158575>` page.
#. Click the **Basic Information** tab, and click **Change** in the **Login Password** row.
#. (Optional) Select email address or mobile number verification, and enter the verification code.

   .. note::

      If neither email address nor mobile number is bound, no verification is required.

#. Enter the old password and new password, and enter the new password again.

   .. note::

      -  The password cannot be the username or the username spelled backwards. For example, if the username is **A12345**, the password cannot be **A12345**, **a12345**, **54321A**, or **54321a**.
      -  To prevent password cracking, the administrator can configure the password policy to define password requirements, such as minimum password length. For details, see :ref:`Password Policy <iam_01_0607>`.

#. Click **OK**.
