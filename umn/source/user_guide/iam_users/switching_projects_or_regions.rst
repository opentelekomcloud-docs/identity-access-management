Switching Projects or Regions
=============================

Resources in different projects or regions are isolated. You can access resources only in the projects or regions for which you have been granted permissions. If you do not have permissions for the current project or region, switch to another project or region which you have been authorized to access.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the upper left corner, select the project or region you want to access from the drop-down list.

   After switching to the target project or region, you can access resources in the project or region.
