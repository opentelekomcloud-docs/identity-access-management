Changing the Login Password of an IAM User
==========================================

As an administrator, you can reset the password of an IAM user if the user has forgotten the password and no email address or mobile number has been bound to the user.

To reset the login password of an IAM user, click **Security Settings** in the row containing the user, click |image1| next to **Login Password** in the **Login Credentials** area, and select a password type.

.. note::

   -  You can reset the password of an IAM user on the **Security Settings** page.
   -  IAM users can change their passwords on the :ref:`Basic Information <iam_01_0703>` tab.

-  **Set by user**: A one-time login URL will be emailed to the user. The user can then click on the link to set a password.
-  **Automatically generated**: A password will be automatically generated and then sent to the user by email.
-  **Set now**: You set a new password and send the new password to the user.
