Deleting an IAM User
====================

.. caution::

   After an IAM user is deleted, they can no longer log in and their username, password, access keys, and authorizations will be cleared and cannot be recovered.

   -  Make sure that the users to be deleted are no longer needed. If you are not sure, disable them rather than delete them so that they can be enabled if any service failures occur. To temporarily disable an IAM user, see :ref:`Basic Information <en-us_topic_0046661675__section1916211354916>`.
   -  To remove an IAM user from a user group, see :ref:`Adding Users to or Removing Users from a User Group <iam_03_0002>`.
