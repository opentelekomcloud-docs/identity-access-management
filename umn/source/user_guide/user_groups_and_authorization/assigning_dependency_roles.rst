Assigning Dependency Roles
==========================

Cloud services interwork with each other. Roles of some services take effect only if they are assigned along with roles of other services.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the as the administrator.

#. In the user group list, click **Authorize** in the row that contains the created user group.

#. On the displayed page, search for a role in the search box in the upper right corner.

#. Select the target role. The system automatically selects the dependency roles.

#. Click |image1| next to the role to view the dependencies.

   For example, the **DNS Administrator** role contains the **Depends** parameter which specifies the dependency roles. When you assign the **DNS Administrator** role to a user group, you also need to assign the **Tenant Guest** and **VPC Administrator** roles to the group for the same project.

#. Click **OK**.
