What Is IAM?
============

Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides identity authentication, permissions management, and access control. With IAM, you can create users for individuals, systems, and applications in your enterprise and grant permissions to these users to manage your resources. Each user has their own security credentials, and you do not need to share your password or access keys with them. You can configure security policies to ensure account security and eliminate information security risks.
