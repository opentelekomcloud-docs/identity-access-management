Logging In as an IAM User
=========================

You can log in to the cloud platform as an IAM user and access cloud services based on granted permissions.

Background
----------

If either of the following has been configured on **Security Settings** > **Login Authentication Policy**, you will see the **Login Verification** page after login:

-  **Recent Login Information** has been enabled.
-  **Custom Information** has been configured.

Procedure
---------

#. On the **Multitenant Login** page, enter **Domain name**, **Username/Email address/Mobile number**, and **Password**, and click **Log In**.

   .. note::

      -  **Domain Name** is a username set in MyWorkplace. It is in the format "**ICU** + *User ID* + *Contract instance number*". ICU stands for identity for customer user.
      -  If this is your first login, change your initial password on the **First Login** page. To ensure account security, change your password periodically.
      -  Enter a verification code on the **Login Verification** page if login authentication has been enabled.

#. On the **Login Verification** page, click **OK**.

   The management console is displayed.
